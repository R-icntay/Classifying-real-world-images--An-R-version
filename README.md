# Classifying real-world images: An R version

Hello! Welcome to the fifth R code walkthrough of the series [Machine Learning Foundations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z9TRANg4c0&list=PLOU2XLYxmsII9mzQ-Xxug4l2o04JBrkLV) where Laurence Moroney,a Developer Advocate at Google working on Artificial Intelligence, takes us through the fundamentals of building machine learned models using TensorFlow.

In this episode, Episode 5, we go beyond the Fashion MNIST and the MNIST datasets into more real-world images. We look at how to use Convolutional Neural Networks to classify complex features, with a hands-on example to tackle a more challenging computer vision problemâ€“classifying images of horses and humans!


 Like the previous R Notebooks, this Notebook tries to replicate the Python Notebook used for this episode.

You can find the R blog post of this code on [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/eR_ic/mlr_5).
